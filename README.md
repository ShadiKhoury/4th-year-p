# 4'th year Grad project in Bc.s in biomedical engineering
my 4th year project for Bc.s in biomedical engineering
## Interpretation
the main objective of this project os to validate diffrent feature impoertnace methods and understand thier diffrences on Real world Clincial data 

To run the Script use Interpoation.py 
where the args are : 
1 ) '--train_data'
2)'--test_data'
3)'--train_labels'
4)'--test_labels'
5)'--model'
6)'--feature_imprtance_type'

and in turn this script predoces a jason file and a Barh plot with the normlized impoertance Scores for each feature for each method
